\title{Find alternative products for all products containing certain active substances}
\usage{
alternative_products(
  srppp,
  active_ingredients,
  details = FALSE,
  missing = FALSE,
  list = FALSE,
  lang = c("de", "fr", "it")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{srppp}{A \link{srppp_dm} object.}

\item{active_ingredients}{Character vector of active ingredient names that will be
matched against the column 'substances_de' in the srppp table 'substances'.}

\item{details}{Should a table of alternative uses with 'wNbr' and 'use_nr' be returned?}

\item{missing}{If this is set to TRUE, uses without alternative product registrations
are listed.}

\item{list}{If TRUE, a list of three tables is returned, a table of uses
without alternative products ("LÃ¼ckenindikationen"), a table of the number
of alternative products for each use, if any, and a detailed table of all
the alternative uses. This argument overrides the arguments 'details' and
'missing'.}

\item{lang}{The language used for the active ingredient names and the returned
tables.}
}
\value{
A \link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble} containing use definitions as defined above, i.e. containing
columns with the application area, crop and pathogen. Depending on the
arguments, columns summarizing or listing the alternative products and/or uses
are also contained.
}
\description{
This function searches for uses of a given list of active substances and reports
either a table of uses with the number of available alternative products for each
use, a detailed table of the alternative product uses, a table of uses without
alternatives, or a list containing these three tables.
}
\details{
A use is defined here as a combination of an application area, a crop
('culture') and a pathogen ('pest'). This means, that for an alternative
product to be found, there has to be an exact match of application
area, crop an pathogen.
