#' Calculate application rates for active ingredients
#'
#' An application rate in g active substance/ha is calculated from information
#' on dosage (product concentration in the application solution), application volume,
#' or directly from the product application rate. This is complicated by the fact
#' that a rate ("expenditure" in the XML file) with units l/ha can refer
#' to the application solution or to the liquid product.
#'
#' In some cases (currently one), external information was found, indicating
#' that the "expenditure" is an application volume [l_per_ha_is_water_volume].
#'
#' @note A reference application volume is used if there is no 'expenditure'.
#' It is selected only based on the product application area. This is not correct
#' if hops ('Hopfen') is the culture, as it has a unique reference application
#' volume of 3000 L/ha.
#'
#' Applications to hops were excluded for calculating mean use rates in the
#' indicator project (Korkaric 2023), arguing that it is not grown in large
#' areas in Switzerland.
#' @param product_uses A tibble containing the columns 'pNbr', 'use_nr',
#' 'application_area_de', 'min_dosage', 'max_dosage', 'min_rate', 'max_rate',
#' from the 'uses' table in a [srppp_dm] object, as well as the columns
#' 'percent' and 'g_per_L' from the 'ingredients' table in a [srppp_dm] object.
#' @param aggregation How to represent a range if present, e.g. "max" (default)
#' or "mean".
#' @param dosage_units If no units are given, or units are "%", then the applied
#' amount in g/ha is calculated using a reference application volume and the
#' dosage. As the dosage units are not explicitly given, we can specify our
#' assumptions about these using this argument (currently not implemented, i.e.
#' specifying the argument has no effect).
#' @param skip_l_per_ha_without_g_per_L Per default, uses where the use rate
#' has units of l/ha are skipped, if there is not product concentration
#' in g/L. This was also done in the 2023 indicator project.
#' @param fix_l_per_ha During the review of the 2023 indicator
#' project calculations, a number of cases were identified where the unit
#' l/ha specifies a water volume, and not a product volume. If TRUE (default),
#' these cases are corrected, if FALSE, these cases are discarded.
