```{r setup, include = TRUE, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy = FALSE, cache = FALSE)
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
library(srppp)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
```

```{r srppp}

```

## Products in microorganism categories

The following list was used to identify product categories containing
microorganisms.

```{r warning = FALSE}
srppp$categories |>
  group_by(category_de) |>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  kable()
```

The resulting product categories containing microorganisms 
were defined as follows:

```{r}
microorganism_categories = c(
  "Lebende Organismen (Bakterien)",
  "Lebende Organismen (Pilze)",
  "Lebende Organismen (gegen Pilze)")
kable(data.frame(Category = microorganism_categories))
```

The corresponding products are shown below.

```{r}
products_in_microorganism_categories <- srppp$products |>
  filter(!isSalePermission) |>
  left_join(srppp$categories, by = "pNbr") |>
  filter(category_de %in% microorganism_categories) |>
  select(pNbr, wNbr, name, category_de) |>
  arrange(pNbr)
n_in_categories <- nrow(products_in_microorganism_categories)
kable(products_in_microorganism_categories)
```

## Insecticides and fungicides containing microorganisms

The following lists of active substances in insecticides and fungicides were
used to establish filter criteria active substances that are microorganisms.

```{r}
srppp$products |>
  filter(!isSalePermission) |>
  left_join(srppp$categories, by = "pNbr") |>
  filter(category_de == "Insektizid") |>
  left_join(srppp$ingredients, by = "pNbr", relationship = "many-to-many") |>
  left_join(srppp$substances, by = "pk") |>
  select(substance_de) |>
  unique() |>
  arrange(substance_de) |>
  kable()

srppp$products |>
  filter(!isSalePermission) |>
  left_join(srppp$categories, by = "pNbr") |>
  filter(category_de == "Fungizid") |>
  left_join(srppp$ingredients, by = "pNbr", relationship = "many-to-many") |>
  left_join(srppp$substances, by = "pk") |>
  select(substance_de) |>
  unique() |>
  arrange(substance_de) |>
  kable()
```

The following genus names were established as filtering criteria.

```{r}
microorganism_genus_names <- c(
  "Bacillus",
  "Beauveria",
  "Metarhizium",
  "Xenorhabdus",
  "Phlebia",
  "Pseudomonas")
kable(data.frame("Genus names" = microorganism_genus_names, check.names = FALSE))
```

This results in the following list of active ingredients.

```{r}
microorganism_regexp <- paste(microorganism_genus_names, collapse = "|")
microorganism_ingredients <- srppp$substances |>
  filter(grepl(microorganism_regexp, substance_de)) |>
  select(pk, substance_de)
kable(microorganism_ingredients)

```

The following products contain one of these active ingredients.

```{r}
additional_products_containing_microorganisms <- srppp$products |>
  filter(!isSalePermission) |>
  left_join(srppp$ingredients, by = "pNbr", relationship = "many-to-many") |>
  filter(pk %in% microorganism_ingredients$pk) |>
  select(-pk) |>
  left_join(srppp$categories, by = "pNbr") |> 
  select(pNbr, wNbr, name, category_de) |>
  arrange(pNbr)
n_additional <- nrow(additional_products_containing_microorganisms)
kable(additional_products_containing_microorganisms)
```

## Summary

In summary, out of `r nrow(srppp$products)` products, there are
`r n_in_categories` in the microorganism categories
as shown above, and
`r n_additional` products in the
insecticide and fungicide categories which contain an active substance that
has a name that contains one of the microorganism genus names listed above.

```{r}
products_containing_microorganisms <- rbind(
  products_in_microorganism_categories, 
  additional_products_containing_microorganisms) |>
  arrange(pNbr, category_de) |>
  unique()
n_unique <- length(unique(products_containing_microorganisms$pNbr))
```

The consolidated list of the `r n_unique` unique products identified in this way
is shown below. Some of these products are listed twice, because they were 
identified via both ways.


```{r}
kable(products_containing_microorganisms)
```
